Protecting the environmental quality of aquatic ecosystems in Texas and the U.S.
is of great interest and importance to the public and the nation’s economy.
Water quality and fish habitat projections in lakes require complex numerical
models that integrate various physical and biochemical processes, e.g. 
hydrodynamics, air-water surface exchange, and biochemical reactions. This research
is to explore means by which advanced computing technology can facilitate software
reuse, data sharing, and decision support within the context of ecosystem management.
Object-oriented method will be used to redesign lake water quality and fish habitat 
models and a component-based modeling system will be developed.

Components in the system will have distinct functions in aquatic ecosystems, can be
reused and applied separately without modifications.&nbsp; A number of components 
can be integrated into new and advanced models.&nbsp; The system will include a 
graphical user interface, a database, and a model component library.&nbsp; It can 
be accessed by users via the Internet.

The system requires full utilization of advanced information technology to overcome
difficulties in bandwidth limitation, communication among the components, parallel
computing algorithm, and data sharing.&nbsp; The system will be designed for three
user levels including general audience, inexperienced water quality modelers and 
experienced ones.&nbsp; It will enable inexperienced people to perform tasks which
were considered impossible otherwise and assists experienced users to accomplish 
more difficult modeling tasks more effectively and efficiently.
